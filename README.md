# catlaser

This is reporistory for catlaser code im working in 15.11.2020 on live stream on youtube. Talk is on Finnish how ever do to audience.

Code runs on Arduino, utilises two rc-servos to move laser module so cats can have moving red dot to chase.

Lost original code, but rewrite allowed me to restructure code better and add couple features that were missing on earlier version. One of them is bigger one, ability to external control of laser turret. Basicly allowing computer to interface with it and send commands over virtual serialport on USB-cable. Other one is more of code structure improvements. Allowing easier changes in future.
